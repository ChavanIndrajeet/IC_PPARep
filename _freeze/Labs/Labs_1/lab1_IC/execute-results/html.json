The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/labs/lab_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Labs\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `labs/lab_1/` folder structure. Update your navigation menu to include:\n\n```\n- text: Assignments\n  menu:\n    - href: labs/lab_1/your_file_name.qmd\n      text: \"Lab 1: Census Data Exploration\"\n```\nIf there is a special character like a colon, you need use double quote mark so that the quarto can identify this as text\n\n# Setup\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load required packages (hint: you need tidycensus, tidyverse, and knitr)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\n# Set your Census API key\ncensus_api_key(\"9c944699f65b68893c6c529610f655faeec5d440\", install = TRUE, overwrite = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"9c944699f65b68893c6c529610f655faeec5d440\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Choose your state for analysis - assign it to a variable called my_state\nmy_state <- \"PA\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n**State Selection:** I have chosen **Pennsylvania** for this analysis because: Philadelphia is my home. I am deeply interested in understanding the factors that contribute to the design of algorithmic systems used to identify communities in need of priority social service funding and outreach. This exercise also provides an opportunity to critically evaluate the quality of census data across the state and assess how data reliability may influence funding decisions that affect vulnerable populations. Additionally, I am excited to possibly contribute in unlocking some important funds for my people.\n\n# Part 2: County-Level Resource Assessment\n\n## 2.1 Data Retrieval\n\n**Your Task:** Use `get_acs()` to retrieve county-level data for your chosen state.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: county level\n- Variables: median household income (B19013_001) and total population (B01003_001)  \n- Year: 2022\n- Survey: acs5\n- Output format: wide\n\n**Hint:** Remember to give your variables descriptive names using the `variables = c(name = \"code\")` syntax.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write your get_acs() code here\nPA_data <- get_acs(geography = \"County\", state = \"PA\", \n                   variables = c(medinc = \"B19013_001\", \n                                 totpop = \"B01003_001\"), #Median Income and Total Population\n                   year = 2022, survey = \"acs5\", \n                   output = \"wide\")\n\nPA_data\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 67 × 6\n   GEOID NAME                           medincE medincM totpopE totpopM\n   <chr> <chr>                            <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1 42001 Adams County, Pennsylvania       78975    3334  104604      NA\n 2 42003 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania   72537     869 1245310      NA\n 3 42005 Armstrong County, Pennsylvania   61011    2202   65538      NA\n 4 42007 Beaver County, Pennsylvania      67194    1531  167629      NA\n 5 42009 Bedford County, Pennsylvania     58337    2606   47613      NA\n 6 42011 Berks County, Pennsylvania       74617    1191  428483      NA\n 7 42013 Blair County, Pennsylvania       59386    2058  122640      NA\n 8 42015 Bradford County, Pennsylvania    60650    2167   60159      NA\n 9 42017 Bucks County, Pennsylvania      107826    1516  645163      NA\n10 42019 Butler County, Pennsylvania      82932    2164  194562      NA\n# ℹ 57 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Clean the county names to remove state name and \"County\" \n# Hint: use mutate() with str_remove()\nPA <- PA_data %>%\n  mutate(\n    # Remove state name from county names\n    county_name = str_remove(NAME, \", Pennsylvania\"),\n    # Remove \"County\" word\n    county_name = str_remove(county_name, \" County\")\n  )\n\n# Display the first few rows\nhead(PA)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  GEOID NAME                         medincE medincM totpopE totpopM county_name\n  <chr> <chr>                          <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>      \n1 42001 Adams County, Pennsylvania     78975    3334  104604      NA Adams      \n2 42003 Allegheny County, Pennsylva…   72537     869 1245310      NA Allegheny  \n3 42005 Armstrong County, Pennsylva…   61011    2202   65538      NA Armstrong  \n4 42007 Beaver County, Pennsylvania    67194    1531  167629      NA Beaver     \n5 42009 Bedford County, Pennsylvania   58337    2606   47613      NA Bedford    \n6 42011 Berks County, Pennsylvania     74617    1191  428483      NA Berks      \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 2.2 Data Quality Assessment\n\n**Your Task:** Calculate margin of error percentages and create reliability categories.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Calculate MOE percentage: (margin of error / estimate) * 100\n- Create reliability categories:\n  -

Consider: Which counties might be poorly served by algorithms that rely on this income data? What factors might contribute to higher uncertainty?]\n\nThe counties like Forest, Sullivan, Union, Montour, and Elk with the highest margins of error are at risk of being misclassified by algorithms that rely heavily on median income estimates for resource allocation. **High uncertainty may be a result of smaller populations, sampling variability, or demographic complexity**, which can reduce survey precision. Policymakers should exercise caution when using these estimates for automated decision-making, as communities with unreliable data may be unfairly prioritized.\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\n\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Comment on the output:** [write something :)]\n\n## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics\n\n**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: tract level\n- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)\n- Use the same state and year as before\n- Output format: wide\n- **Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names.
