## About Me
I am a city planner, urban designer, and architect passionate about creating resilient, equitable, and human-centered urban systems. I am currently pursuing a Master’s in City and Regional Planning at the University of Pennsylvania, with concentrations in Smart Cities and Transportation Planning. My academic interests focus on climate resilience, spatial analytics, and public policy; exploring how data-driven design can optimize resources and strengthen urban systems.

With professional experience in large-scale planning, blue-economy master planning, and redevelopment projects across India, I bring a multidisciplinary approach that blends creativity with analytical insight. I believe in cities that are both efficient and empathetic where design, technology, and collaboration come together to shape inclusive and sustainable futures.
